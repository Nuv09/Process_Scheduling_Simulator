# Process Scheduling Simulator - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)

## **Project Overview**  
This project simulates process scheduling using the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** algorithm. The system calculates **average waiting time**, **average turnaround time**, and **CPU utilization**, and visualizes the execution of processes using a **Gantt chart**. The program also supports context switching and preemption.

## **Features**  
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** Scheduling Algorithm.
- **Context Switching**: Simulates a 1ms context switch time between processes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and outputs **Average Turnaround Time**, **Average Waiting Time**, and **CPU Utilization**.
- **Gantt Chart**: Displays the order and timing of processes in an easy-to-read format.

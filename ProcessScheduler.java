 * What is this program doing?
It is simulating a Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) CPU scheduling algorithm.

- SRTF is a preemptive scheduling algorithm, meaning it always picks the process with the least
 remaining time left to execute.
- If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running process, 
 the CPU switches to that new process.
- The program also considers context switches,
which take 1ms each time the CPU switches from one process to another.

/*
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Defining the Process class
The Process class represents a single process with attributes like:

id → Process ID
arrivalTime → When the process arrives
burstTime → Total execution time needed
remainingTime → How much execution time is still needed
completionTime → When the process finished execution
waitingTime → Total time the process spent waiting in the queue
turnaroundTime → Total time from arrival to completion
*/

3- Uses a priority queue to always pick the shortest remaining time process.
4- Handles context switching (adds a delay when switching between processes).
5- Handles CPU idle time (if no process is ready to run).
6- Calculates and prints CPU utilization, waiting time, and turnaround time.
